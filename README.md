### Horizontal Scaling of Software Systems

This project involves three main tasks:

1. **Implementing a Load Balancing Algorithm**:
   - Develop a load balancing algorithm according to your specific variant.
   - Cover the algorithm with unit tests to ensure its correctness.

2. **Implementing Integration Tests for the Load Balancer**:
   - Create integration tests to verify that the load balancer distributes requests across multiple servers as expected.
   - Ensure the load balancer is running correctly and that responses indicate which server handled each request.

3. **Setting Up Continuous Integration**:
   - Configure CI to run integration tests automatically.
